# Welcome

This will be the home for my EE 300W project, **Collision Avoidance Quadcopter**

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to recreate a typical 4 propeller UAV but give it the capabilities to avoid obstacles and collsions in its path. This will be done by configuring the flight controller to react to inputs from ultrasonic sensors mounted on the frame of the quadcopter. The build will consist of generic ESCs, 3 phase motors, a frame, an Arduino Uno as the flight controller.
